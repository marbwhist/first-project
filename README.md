*Group participants: 
  Grant Leach, Nathan Prows, Mary Whistler, Veronica Hamilton

*The kind of data you'd like to work with/field you're interested in (e.g., geodata, weather data, etc.)
Movie Data - omdb API and also used a csv file of highest grossing movies


The kinds of questions you'll be asking of that data
1. Are there any recurring themes of the plots of the highest grossing movies 2008-2018?
2. What were the most popular actors/actresses in the same movies?
3. Which scoring model is most reflective of the financial success of the movie?
4. What are the most popular genres of each year?


Scope additional notes:
-We define "highest grossing" as grossing more than $300mil in the year it was released.
-Our data set is defined by movies released 2008-2018.
-Actor/actress popularity is defined by how many movies they appeared in within that list of movies.
-The plot will be defined by the synopsis shown in OMDB.
-The most popular genre will be defined by which genre appears the most time in each year.
