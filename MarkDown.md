***To Begin  

First we had to source our data:  

    1. We started by finding a csv file on Kaggle that showed all of the highest grossing worldwide movie sales from the last 50 years.  
    2. We narrowed down the data by pulling only films that were released in 2008 or later.  
    3. We further narrowed down the data by pulling only films that grossed over $100mil to find the true top blockbusters.  
    4. We used the OMDB API to fill in the Metacritic scores, cast names, and film synopsis  
    
***Answering our questions

    4. Create an empty list to count the words  
    5. Create a for loop to run the word counter in the master list and count the most recurring words  
    6. Zip together the word count key and word count list, and add the words to the word counter list  
    7. Make a new data frame to hold the words  
    8. Create a for loop for the value counts of most occuring words
